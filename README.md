# Criminal Project
--------

Most of the technology are limited to certain project so my goal from this project was to take technology all over the place. The goal was to make a digital system for jail where the officers use this app to create, read, update and delete jailers from their list. After their work is done, we are also given the option to write this in file so that it can be printed out and can be used for further referenes. The file can also be digitally sent to other jail for more information.<br />
Criminal Project was my second project in many year of my computing. This project is made from C++ and tries to make a digital system for jail. A real Production Application can be made with this codebase if contributors are there to help. Everybody is welcome!!<br /> <br />
